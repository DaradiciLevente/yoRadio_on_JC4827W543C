# yoRadio MOD for GUITION JC4827W543C.

This project is based on the original yoRadio project which you can find [here.](https://github.com/e2002/yoradio)

The hardware of this board contains a display that is not currently supported by yoRadio, but there are many people in the yoRadio community who offer to help you when a challenge arises.

But I was lucky that two yoRadio fans already had the solution for adapting this display and the DAC that is integrated into this board.

I would like to thank the users [@CoolmdXi](https://github.com/CoolmdXi) and [@bobcroft](https://github.com/bobcroft)
who provided me with working code for this board.
The discussion that helped me get yoRadio working can be seen [here.](https://github.com/e2002/yoradio/issues/105)
Here I also received the working code with the working graphics driver, with the working touchscreen and with the DAC set correctly.
Thanks again for the help!
